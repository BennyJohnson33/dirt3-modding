DiRT3 Modding
============

This repository contains all my research and tools into for modding DiRT3.
A lot of it may be applicable to other Codemasters games, but has not been tested.

Templates
---------

The templates directory contains template files for 010 Editor.
They are made in a simple C-like language, so they should be readable even if you haven't used 010 Editor.

Tools
-----

The tools directory contains source code for any modding tools.
Currently the only tool is PSSG Manager, this is used for loading PSSG files (mostly containing model and texture data).
It will eventually be used to edit the PSSG files and to import/export models and textures allowing for custom cars/tracks.
